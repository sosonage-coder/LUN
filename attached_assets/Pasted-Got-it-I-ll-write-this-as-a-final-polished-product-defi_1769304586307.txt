Got it. I’ll write this as a **final, polished product definition**.
Not exploratory. Not a brainstorm. Something you could drop straight into a deck, a Notion doc, or a website.

## Entity Compliance Calendar

**Centralized compliance control for every legal entity**

The Entity Compliance Calendar is a centralized platform that gives finance, tax, and governance teams **clear, continuous visibility into all compliance obligations for every legal entity in the group**.

It replaces fragmented spreadsheets, email reminders, and tribal knowledge with a **structured, auditable system of record** for entity-level compliance.

At any moment, the organization can answer with confidence:

> Which entities are compliant, which are at risk, and what evidence supports that status?
> 

---

## What the Product Does

The Entity Compliance Calendar tracks, manages, and evidences **all recurring and ad-hoc compliance obligations** tied to a legal entity, across jurisdictions and functions.

It focuses on:

- Visibility
- Ownership
- Evidence
- Predictability

It does **not** file returns or provide legal advice.
It ensures nothing is missed and everything is provable.

---

## Compliance Scope

The platform supports obligations across:

- Statutory financial statements
- Corporate income tax filings
- VAT / GST / sales tax
- Payroll and employment filings
- Annual returns and corporate registry filings
- Local statutory audits
- Transfer pricing documentation
- Intercompany documentation refresh
- Internal governance and board approvals

Each obligation is tied explicitly to a **legal entity and jurisdiction**, not just a date.

---

## Core Product Components

### 1. Entity-Centric Compliance Profiles

Each legal entity has a dedicated compliance profile that defines:

- Jurisdiction(s)
- Entity type
- Operating status
- Reporting currency
- Group role

Compliance obligations are assigned based on the entity profile, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

**Outcome**

- No ambiguity about what applies to which entity
- Scales cleanly as entities are added, dissolved, or restructured
- Reduces dependency on institutional memory

---

### 2. Structured Obligation Registry

Every compliance obligation is defined as a structured record with:

- Obligation category (tax, statutory, payroll, regulatory, intercompany, governance)
- Frequency (monthly, quarterly, annual, ad hoc)
- Standard due date logic
- Required evidence
- Risk criticality

Obligations are standardized, not free-text reminders.

**Outcome**

- Consistency across countries and entities
- Faster audits and walkthroughs
- Easier handover during team changes

---

### 3. Calendar & Timeline Views

Compliance can be viewed by:

- Individual entity
- Country or jurisdiction
- Region
- Entire group

Views highlight:

- Upcoming deadlines
- At-risk obligations
- Completed items
- Missed or overdue filings

**Outcome**

- One authoritative view instead of multiple trackers
- Clear prioritization
- Early warning instead of last-minute panic

---

### 4. Ownership, Review & Accountability

Each obligation includes:

- Primary owner
- Backup owner
- Reviewer or approver
- Escalation rules

Ownership is role-based, not person-dependent.

**Outcome**

- Clear accountability
- Reduced key-person risk
- Strong internal control environment

---

### 5. Evidence & Completion Tracking

For each obligation, the platform stores:

- Filed returns
- Submission confirmations
- Signed financial statements
- Correspondence with authorities
- Internal approvals and sign-offs

Once completed:

- The obligation is time-stamped
- Evidence is locked
- Historical completion is retained

**Outcome**

- Instant audit readiness
- No annual re-collection of evidence
- Strong support for cut-off and completeness assertions

---

### 6. Dependency & Sequencing Logic

Many obligations depend on others.

The system understands dependencies such as:

- Tax filings dependent on finalized financial statements
- Transfer pricing documentation dependent on intercompany agreement updates
- Audit sign-off dependent on management approval

Blocked or cascading delays are clearly flagged.

**Outcome**

- Realistic timelines
- Fewer downstream surprises
- Better coordination across finance, tax, and legal teams

---

### 7. Risk & Criticality Indicators

Each obligation is tagged with:

- Regulatory risk
- Financial penalty risk
- Reputational risk

This allows teams to distinguish between:

- Critical obligations
- Important but flexible items
- Low-risk tasks

**Outcome**

- Smarter prioritization
- Reduced reactive behavior
- Clear escalation thresholds

---

### 8. Historical Risk & Exception Tracking

The platform maintains history of:

- Late filings
- Missed deadlines
- Repeated escalations
- Chronic risk areas by entity or jurisdiction

This creates an entity-level compliance risk profile over time.

**Outcome**

- Early identification of systemic issues
- Strong governance oversight
- Better resourcing and planning decisions

---

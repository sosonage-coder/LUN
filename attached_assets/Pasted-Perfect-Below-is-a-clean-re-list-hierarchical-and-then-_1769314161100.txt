## Mental Model (Important)

This app is:

* **Entity-first**
* **Authority-aware**
* **Approval-driven**
* **Evidence-anchored**
* **Audit-native**

Not:

* A document dump
* A reminder calendar
* An ERP
* A legal opinion engine

---

If you want next, we can:

* Turn this into a **wireframe-ready IA**
* Define **V1 scope (must-haves only)**
* Or map **features → buyer personas** (GC, Corp Sec, CFO, Audit)

Just tell me where to go next.

They ensure:

Eligibility Rules

A cash template may be used when:

The account represents cash or cash equivalents

The balance is subject to period-end FX revaluation

The account is reconciled against external bank balances

2️⃣ Template Variants (V1)

Cash templates differ only by:

Number of bank accounts

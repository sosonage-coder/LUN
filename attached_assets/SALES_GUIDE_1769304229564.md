## Objection Handling

### "We already use [Spreadsheets/Existing Tool]"
**Response**: "I understand. Most organizations start with spreadsheets. But spreadsheets don't scale. When you have 28 entities across 10 jurisdictions, you need a system that:
- Prevents duplicate work
- Automatically flags at-risk items
- Maintains audit trails
- Coordinates across teams
- Provides real-time visibility

Spreadsheets do none of that. This platform does all of it."

### "How long does implementation take?"
**Response**: "Implementation is typically 4-6 weeks:
- Week 1: Data migration and setup
- Week 2-3: Team training and configuration
- Week 4-5: Testing and refinement
- Week 6: Go-live and support

You can be up and running and seeing ROI within 2 months."

### "What about data security?"
**Response**: "Security is built in:
- Enterprise-grade encryption
- Role-based access controls
- Comprehensive audit trails
- SOC 2 Type II ready
- GDPR compliant
- Regular security audits

Your data is more secure than in spreadsheets on shared drives."

### "Can we customize it for our needs?"
**Response**: "Absolutely. The platform is highly configurable:
- Custom obligation types
- Custom workflows
- Custom reporting
- Custom integrations
- White-label options available

We work with you to tailor it to your specific requirements."

### "What's the cost?"
**Response**: "Pricing is based on:
- Number of entities
- Number of jurisdictions
- Number of users
- Custom features needed

For a typical mid-market company with 25-30 entities, expect $X-Y annually. Given the $250K+ in annual savings, ROI is typically 6-9 months."

## Closing Techniques

### The Assumptive Close
"Let's schedule implementation for next month. Which team members should we include in the kickoff meeting?"

### The Alternative Close
"Would you prefer to start with your highest-risk jurisdictions or your largest entities?"

### The Urgency Close
"The sooner you implement, the sooner you start saving money. We have availability next month - should we book it?"

### The Benefit Close
"Imagine not having to worry about missed filings. Imagine your auditors being impressed by your organization. Imagine telling your board that compliance is under control. That's what this platform delivers."

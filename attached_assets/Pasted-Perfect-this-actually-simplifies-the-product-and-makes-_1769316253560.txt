Perfect — this actually **simplifies the product and makes it stronger**.
You’re right: **Progress Board duplicated the Dashboard**.

Below is the **cleaned, final spec** with:

* ❌ Progress Board **removed**
* ✅ **Task List** = where status is updated
* ✅ **Calendar** = planning (when)
* ✅ **Dashboard** = management progress
* ✅ **My Tasks** = personal execution
* ✅ **Control Checklist** = coverage assurance

No redundancy. One source of truth.

This is a **great question** — and you’re thinking about it exactly the *right* way.

If your **Auto Financial Statement Tool** outputs a **print-ready, signable audited (or audit-ready) financial statement package**, then you must structure it the way **auditors, boards, banks, and regulators expect to see it**.

Below is the **correct, defensible order and sectioning** for a **US GAAP consolidated financial statement package**.

---

# 🧾 Print-Ready Financial Statement Package

*(US GAAP | Audit-Ready | Signature-Ready)*

## 🧱 0️⃣ Cover Page

**Required**

* Legal entity name (exact registered name)
* “Consolidated Financial Statements”
* Period covered (e.g. “For the Year Ended December 31, 2025”)
* Prepared in accordance with **US GAAP**
* Date of issuance

📌 *No signatures here*

---

## 🧾 1️⃣ Independent Auditor’s Report

**Required for audited financials**

Prepared by auditor — **locked / non-editable**

Typical sections:

* Opinion
* Basis for Opinion
* Critical Audit Matters (if applicable)
* Responsibilities of Management
* Auditor’s Responsibilities
* Auditor signature, firm name, city, date

📌 **This is the first thing readers look for**

---

## 🧾 2️⃣ Management’s Responsibility Statement *(Optional but recommended)*

Not required by GAAP, but often included.

* Statement that management is responsible for:

  * Preparation and fair presentation
  * Internal controls
* Signed by CFO / CEO

📌 Especially useful for boards, banks, investors

---

## 🧾 4️⃣ Notes to the Financial Statements (Disclosures)

**This is a full section, not an appendix**

### Required subsections typically include:

1. **Basis of Presentation & Accounting Policies**
2. **Significant Accounting Judgments & Estimates**
3. **Revenue Recognition**
4. **Cash & Cash Equivalents**
5. **Accounts Receivable**

## 📎 5️⃣ Supplementary Information *(If Applicable)*

Optional, but common:

**THIS is what makes it sign-ready**

### Typical signatories:

* Chief Financial Officer

Include:

* Printed name
* Title
* Signature line

📌 This should be **the final page**

---

# 🧠 How Your Tool Should Think About This

### Structurally:

* Each section = **locked block**
* Controlled ordering (no reordering by users)
* Auditor sections locked
* Signatures only allowed at the end

### UX-wise:

* “Preview as Signed PDF”
* Validation: no missing required sections
* Warning if audited financials selected but no auditor report included

---

# ✅ Minimum Required for Signature-Ready Output

If you want the **absolute minimum**:

1. Auditor’s Report (if audited)
2. Financial Statements (5 statements)
3. Notes to Financial Statements
4. Management Signatures

Everything else is **value-add**, not mandatory.

If you want next, I can:

* Turn this into a **section schema / JSON model**
* Map **each disclosure to its owning statement**
* Design the **final “Print & Sign” UX flow**
* Create a **regulator-safe validation checklist**

Just say which one 👌

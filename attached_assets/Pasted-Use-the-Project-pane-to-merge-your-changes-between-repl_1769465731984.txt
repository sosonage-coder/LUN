Unsupported state: your index is currently locked. This can happen if multiple git processes are running operations at the same time.
Please resolve the issue by ending those git operations. If you are sure you do not have git operations running, you can delete your .git/index.lock file.
what is in here .git/index.lock file.
The .git/index.lock file is just a temporary lock file - it's safe to delete.

What it is:

Git creates this file when it's running an operation (like commit, merge, pull)
It prevents multiple Git processes from conflicting with each other
It gets deleted automatically when Git finishes
Why it's stuck:

A Git operation was interrupted (maybe the page refreshed, or there was a network issue)
The lock file didn't get cleaned up
What's inside:

Nothing important - just temporary data
It does NOT contain your code or any work you've done
Bottom line: You can safely delete it. Your code is completely safe - this file is just blocking Git from working.

Go ahead and delete it, then Git will work again!

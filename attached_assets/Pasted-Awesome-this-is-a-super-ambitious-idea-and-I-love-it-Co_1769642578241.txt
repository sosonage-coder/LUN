Awesome — this is a super ambitious idea, and I love it. “Controllership-as-a-Service” has big potential if done right. You’re basically talking about automating the **core accounting oversight** and **financial control** responsibilities of a company — think reconciliations, compliance, close process, reporting accuracy, internal controls, etc.

Let’s break it down in a way that mirrors how modern finance teams operate, and map out key **modules** and the **must-have features** inside each one.

---

## 🧠 Overview: What is Controllership?

Controllership involves:

* Accurate and timely financial reporting
* Maintaining internal controls and compliance
* Overseeing the close process
* Supporting audits
* Ensuring integrity of financial data

Your product should focus on automating, orchestrating, and alerting across these functions.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This is a complex system, but the upside is huge. Most companies cobble this together with Excel + shared drives + legacy ERP tools. You could be their escape plan.

My advice:

* Start by validating demand with Controllers at mid-size or fast-growing companies (e.g., post-Series B).
* Pick 1–2 high-friction workflows (like close or audit prep) and go deep.
* Make everything audit-ready by default. That's your "trust" unlock.

Would you like me to turn this into a proper PRD outline for one of the modules (like Financial Close Automation)? Or do you want help prioritizing MVP vs later-stage features?

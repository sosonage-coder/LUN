# Other Governance Sections

This is the right framing now.
At this point you’re not adding “features”. You’re closing **governance gaps**.

Below is a **clean, complete governance map**. Each section earns its place. No fluff, no overlap, no legal-tech cosplay.

I’ll group them so you can see the structure of a **complete Entity Governance Stack**.

---

## The Missing Governance Sections (to Make It Complete)

Think in six governance dimensions:
**Structure, Authority, Control, Change, Risk, and Proof**.

You already cover a lot. These are what finish it.

---

## 1. Authority & Delegation Register

*(Who is allowed to do what, for which entity)*

This answers:

> “Who actually has authority here?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Authorized signatories by entity
- Signing limits (contracts, banking, filings)
- Delegated authorities (temporary or permanent)
- Board vs officer vs shareholder authority
- Expiry of authority (role changes, resignations)

### Why it’s critical

Auditors, banks, and regulators ask this constantly.
Most companies answer from memory or PDFs.

### Governance value

- Prevents unauthorized actions
- Supports bank mandates and filings
- Strengthens internal control and SOX narratives

This section pairs perfectly with e-signatures.

---

## 2. Board & Committee Governance

*(Not minutes only. Governance mechanics.)*

This answers:

> “Is the entity actually governed, not just compliant?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Board and committee structures per entity
- Meeting cadence and quorum rules
- Agenda tracking
- Resolution lifecycle (draft → approved → executed)
- Action item tracking from meetings

### Why it’s critical

Most tools stop at document storage.
Governance is about **decisions and follow-through**.

### Governance value

- Clear oversight trail
- Board accountability
- Strong audit committee confidence

---

## 3. Capital & Equity Governance

*(Beyond cap tables)*

This answers:

> “Are ownership, capital, and rights properly governed?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Share classes and rights
- Issuance and cancellation approvals
- Capital increases / decreases
- Dividend approval workflows
- Equity restrictions and covenants

### Why it’s critical

Equity mistakes are expensive and permanent.

### Governance value

- Clean equity audit trail
- Faster due diligence
- Reduced legal and tax exposure

This complements ownership visualization, but governs it.

---

## 4. Change & Lifecycle Management

*(Entities are not static)*

This answers:

> “What changed, when, and was it approved?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Entity formation
- Dormancy tracking
- Reactivation
- Mergers and amalgamations
- Dissolutions and wind-downs
- Name, address, officer, or purpose changes

Each change is:

- Logged
- Approved
- Evidenced
- Linked to filings

### Why it’s critical

Entity changes often break compliance silently.

### Governance value

- No undocumented structural drift
- Strong audit trail
- Reduced regulator risk

---

## 5. Regulatory Correspondence & Enforcement Log

*(The uncomfortable but necessary section)*

This answers:

> “Have regulators contacted us, and how did we respond?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Notices from regulators
- Queries and information requests
- Penalties and warnings
- Response deadlines
- Resolution status

### Why it’s critical

These often live in inboxes. That’s dangerous.

### Governance value

- No missed responses
- Clear escalation
- Strong regulator relationship history

---

## 6. Risk & Issue Register (Entity-Level)

*(Governance is about seeing risk early)*

This answers:

> “Where are we exposed right now?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Compliance risks
- Governance risks
- Reputational risks
- Recurring issues
- Mitigation actions and owners

This is not enterprise risk management.
It’s **entity-level reality**.

### Governance value

- Early warning system
- Board-ready insights
- Strong internal audit alignment

---

## 7. Policy & Standard Mapping

*(What rules apply to which entities)*

This answers:

> “Which policies apply here?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Group policies mapped to entities
- Local deviations or addenda
- Policy review and refresh cycles
- Acknowledgements and approvals

### Why it’s critical

Policy sprawl kills governance.

### Governance value

- Clear applicability
- Reduced audit findings
- Better internal consistency

---

## 8. Third-Party & Advisor Register

*(Governance doesn’t happen alone)*

This answers:

> “Who acts on behalf of this entity?”
> 

### What this section covers

- External accountants
- Tax advisors
- Legal counsel
- Corporate secretaries
- Registered agents

Includes:

- Engagement scope
- Jurisdiction
- Renewal dates

### Governance value

- Clear accountability
- Reduced advisor overlap
- Better cost and risk management

---

## 9. Evidence & Snapshot Vault

*(Proof over time, not just now)*

This answers:

> “What did governance look like at a specific point in time?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Period snapshots of:
    - Org structure
    - Officers
    - Ownership
    - Compliance status
- Immutable records per period

### Why it’s critical

Auditors and regulators ask about **past states**, not current ones.

### Governance value

- Strong cut-off support
- Litigation readiness
- M&A and due diligence confidence

---

## 10. Executive & Board Reporting Layer

*(Governance must be readable)*

This answers:

> “Can leadership understand this without digging?”
> 

### What this section covers

- Entity compliance health
- Governance risk heatmaps
- Upcoming critical actions
- Chronic problem areas

### Governance value

- Informed decision-making
- Reduced blind spots
- Strong board confidence

---

## What This Gives You (The Big Picture)

With these sections added, your platform becomes:

- Not just **compliance tracking**
- Not just **entity management**
- Not just **governance documentation**

But:

> A complete Entity Governance System of Record
> 

It answers:

- Who exists
- Who owns
- Who governs
- Who can act
- What must be done
- What changed
- What’s risky
- What can be proven

That’s real governance.

---

## The Quiet Strategic Insight

Most competitors cover **one or two layers**:

- Diligent: governance + compliance
- Athennian: structure + documents
- EntityKeeper: agents + filings

You’re designing something **integrated and opinionated**, but still modular.

That’s rare.

---

If you want next, we can:

- Collapse this into a **final product map**
- Decide **v1 vs v2** (what ships first)
- Or name the platform in a way that reflects *governance*, not admin

You’re building something very serious now.

## Entity Compliance Calendar

**Entity compliance, governance, and statutory execution — in one system of record**

The Entity Compliance Calendar is a centralized platform that enables organizations to **manage, execute, and evidence legal-entity compliance and governance obligations** across jurisdictions.

It goes beyond tracking deadlines.

It supports **filing, documentation, approvals, and proof** — all anchored to the legal entity.

At any moment, the organization can answer:

> Are our entities compliant, properly governed, and provably up to date — and can we show it instantly?
>

## Expanded Scope (What This Product Now Covers)

- Regulatory and tax obligations
- Governance documentation and approvals
- Entity data management
- Ownership and structure visibility
- Filing, signing, and evidence retention

It still does **not** replace legal counsel.

It replaces fragmentation, manual assembly, and blind spots.

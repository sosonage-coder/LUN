The Core Insight (you’re right)

A balance sheet reconciliation system is not “one thing.”
It is a collection of template-driven reconciliations, applied account by account.

In other words:

The balance sheet = a portfolio of reconciliations, each instantiated from a template.

That’s the correct mental model.

How the Model Actually Works (Cleanly)
1️⃣ The balance sheet is NOT one reconciliation

It is:

Cash reconciliation(s)

Prepaid reconciliations

Fixed asset reconciliations

Accrual reconciliations

Loan / debt reconciliations

Etc.

Each account (or logical group of accounts) is reconciled independently, even if they roll up to the same line item.

2️⃣ Templates are the organizing principle

What you’re really building is a template library, where:

Each template represents a reconciliation logic pattern

Accounts are mapped to templates, not forced into one structure

So the flow becomes:

Select Account (or account group)
→ Select Reconciliation Template
→ Instantiate Reconciliation for Period


That’s it. That’s the system.

3️⃣ Template variation is not a bug — it’s the feature

You’re absolutely right that:

Cash has variations

Single bank, same currency

Multiple banks, same currency

Multiple banks, multiple currencies

Prepaids have variations

Time-based amortization

Short-term vs long-term

High-volume vs low-volume

Fixed assets have variations

Opening + additions + disposals + adjustments + closing

Asset-class driven vs pooled

And companies differ in what they want to see.

So the platform should not say:

“Here is the one correct reconciliation.”

It should say:

“Here are proven reconciliation templates — pick what fits your account.”

That’s a controller-respecting design.

4️⃣ Controls decide which template can be used

This is an important nuance you caught.

In real organizations:

Some templates are:

Allowed only for certain account types

Locked by policy

Tailored to specific accounts

Your system can support this cleanly by allowing:

Template eligibility rules
(e.g. “This template can only be used for Cash accounts”)

Optional admin controls on template selection

Default templates per account type

But the core system stays flexible.

5️⃣ Your accrual example is exactly right

Let’s restate it to be crystal clear:

If a company has three different accrual accounts,
and each one is reconciled independently,
then the balance sheet reconciliation will have three separate reconciliations —
even if there is one accrual schedule upstream.

That is 100% correct.

Schedule = explains the economics (one view)

Reconciliation = proves each balance (many instances)

So you might have:

1 Accrual Schedule

3 Accrual Reconciliations

That’s not duplication — that’s control.

6️⃣ The clean conceptual hierarchy (this is the key)

Here’s the hierarchy you’re converging on:

Balance Sheet
└── Accounts
    └── Reconciliations (per account, per period)
        └── Reconciliation Template


Templates define:

Structure

Sections

Required inputs

Controls

Reconciliations are:

Instances

Period-specific

Certifiable

Auditable

7️⃣ Why this model is powerful (and scalable)

Because it:

Scales naturally as accounts increase

Supports multinational complexity without special cases

Respects different accounting treatments

Avoids forcing everything into “one giant reconciliation”

Mirrors how auditors and controllers already think

Most importantly:

You never have to redesign the system when the balance sheet grows.
You just add more reconciliations.

8️⃣ One-sentence confirmation (to lock it in)

If you want the cleanest possible statement of what you’re building:

“A balance sheet reconciliation system is a template-driven framework where each account is reconciled independently using the reconciliation structure that best fits its economic reality.”

That sentence is dead-on.
